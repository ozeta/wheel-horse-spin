Verification pass complete and label size increased.

Summary:

Dynamic rotation: Initialized at raceStart via initDynamicBoost(). Countdown hint shows the current key; before rotation first key is default 'E'. No stale INPUT_KEY references remain.
Rotation logic: rotateBoostKey() enforces non-repeat, releases held boost, flashes highlight, plays audio. Frame check uses performance.now(); interval constant correct.
Input handling: Ignores keys while typing in editable fields; normalizes Space; release sent on key change and on keyup.
HUD updates: Panel enlarged (308x121). Instruction label size raised from 14 to 17 (~21%).
Safety: No infinite loops, no undefined vars; _boostDown scoped globally; countdown header now appends boost key during countdown ticks.
Optional improvements (tell me if you’d like any):

Start rotation during countdown (so key may change pre-race).
Accessibility toggle to fix key (reduce cognitive load).
Visual indicator for upcoming next key (preview ghost).
Volume control or mute for cue.
Let me know if you want any of those or to proceed with a commit.
